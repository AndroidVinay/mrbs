{"name":"Mrbs + bootstrap","body":"Fork of: Meeting Room Booking System\r\nhttp://mrbs.sourceforge.net/\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Meeting Room Booking System (MRBS) is a PHP-based application for\r\nbooking meeting rooms (surprisingly!). I got annoyed with the piles of books\r\nwhich were being used to book meetings. They were slow, hard to edit and only\r\nat the reception desk. I thought that a nice web-based system would be much\r\nnicer.\r\n\r\nSome parts of this are based on WebCalender 0.9.4 by Craig Knudsen \r\n(http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/webcalendar/) but there is now very little\r\nwhich is similar. There are fundamental design goal differences between\r\nWebCalendar and MRBS - WC is for individuals, MRBS is for meeting rooms.\r\n\r\nThe fork: An attempt at sprucing up the layout.\r\nHere are some screenshots(click for full size).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tompi/mrbs/raw/master/bs1.png\">\r\n\t<img src=\"https://github.com/tompi/mrbs/raw/master/bs1-small.png\">\r\n</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tompi/mrbs/raw/master/bs2.png\">\r\n\t<img src=\"https://github.com/tompi/mrbs/raw/master/bs2-small.png\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n------\r\nTo Use\r\n------\r\nSee the INSTALL file for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nOnce it's installed try going to http://yourhost/mrbs/ - if you loaded the\r\nsample data, this should give you a view of the first area meeting rooms\r\nfor today. The (+) symbol means you can add new meetings by clicking\r\nthere. Try it - it should all be pretty obvious. If you haven't loaded the\r\nsample data, start by clicking on Admin to add your Areas and Rooms.\r\n\r\nBy default, anyone can connect and only demo users \"alice\" and \"bob\" can add \r\nnew meetings (passwords \"a\" and \"b\"), and only connections\r\nfrom user \"administrator\"/\"secret\" are administrators. Only administrators \r\ncan add rooms and areas, and modify any other users' meetings.  See \r\nAUTHENTICATION for a more complete description of the authentication.\r\n\r\nIf you copy testdata.php into your web site, you can view\r\nhttp://yourhost/mrbs/testdata.php - it will generate a whole load of random\r\nappointments to fill up the calendar and let you play around. (Don't leave\r\ntestdata.php in your web site, though.)\r\n\r\nThe latest version was tested with PHP 4.3.2, Apache 1.3.28, and either\r\nMySQL 4.0.14 or PostgreSQL 7.2. It should work on just about anything\r\nthat's got PHP4 with MySQL or PostgreSQL support but PostgreSQL 7.3 and above.\r\nMRBS has also been somewhat tested on PHP 5.1.2, MySQL 5.0.18 and Apache\r\n2.2.0, using both the mysql and mysqli database access methods.\r\n\r\nIt should be pretty easy to adjust it to your corporate colours - the file\r\nmrbs.css is used on every page, as is style.inc. Just fiddle with these until\r\nyou get the result you like. \r\n\r\nSee COPYING for licensing info.\r\n\r\nSee NEWS for a history of changes.\r\n\r\nSee AUTHENTICATION for information about user authentication/passwords.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nRequirements:\r\n-------------\r\n- PHP4/5 with MySQL and/or PostgreSQL support\r\n- MySQL or PostgreSQL\r\n- Any web server that is supported by PHP\r\n\r\nRecommended:\r\n- JavaScript-enabled browser\r\n- CSS-enabled browser\r\n- PHP module connection to the server (also called SAPI) if you want to use any\r\n  of the basic http authentication schemes provided.\r\n\r\n(If you are considering porting MRBS to another database, see README.sqlapi)\r\n\r\nWarning:\r\n- Some users reported errors using some accelerators (APC, PHP Accelerator).\r\n  If you get messages like this : \"Internal Zend error - Missing class\r\n  information for ...\", your accelerator is the cause.\r\n\r\n------\r\nUsage:\r\n------\r\nThe current project maintainer reports using it at work with about 150 clients.\r\nMany other reports of successful use have been seen on the MRBS mailing list,\r\nand your report would be welcome there too. Let us know who is using MRBS!\r\n\r\n$Id: README 798 2008-04-13 19:59:24Z jberanek $\r\n","tagline":"A nice and smooth ui for mrbs","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
